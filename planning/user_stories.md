## CORE FEATURES

1. As a user,I want to be able to see the list of available maps with markers, so that I can see the places of interest.
2. As a user, I want to be able to see a description and/or image when I hover over/click on the markers so that I can see what is at the marker location.
3. As a logged-in user, I want to see what maps others have created and be able to _favourite_(bookmark) the ones I like, so I can find them in the future.
4. As a logged-in user,I want to **add markers of interest on a map**, each marker with its own **title, descriptions and image**, so that I can add information to customize a map.
5. As logged-in user, I want to be able to **edit** maps, including add/edit/remove markers I created, so that I can update my maps.

6. As logged-in user, I want to see my favourite maps and the maps I have created on my **profile page**, so that I can share my profile with others.

7. As a non-logged-in user, I shouldnâ€™t be able to edit maps shared by others, because I didn't create those maps.

- As a logged-in user, I want to have an option to set my profile as private, so only those with a link can see my profile.
- As a logged-in user, I want to my map to be automatically categorized(_smart_) based on the title I assigned, so that I can save time typing.
