## About

WikiMap is a web app where an user may create fully customized maps. The user may add markers (aka pins or waypoints) to a map with a text title, description and an image. The user may also choose a basemap from a list of 15 options. Anyone may explore WikiMap's collection, and you may register to create your own maps, save favourite maps and share your profile.

WikiMap is designed for mobile devices, tablets and desktops. Its layout can adapt responsively depending on the screen size.
